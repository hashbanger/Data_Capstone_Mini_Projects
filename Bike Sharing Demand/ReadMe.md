Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is   
automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location   
and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location,  
arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which ca  
be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with   
weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

For this competition, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the en  
of the month. You must predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only informatio  
available prior to the rental period.
